# About Me

Hi, I’m Katerina 👋  
I’m transitioning into data analytics after several years working in the insurance industry, where I regularly worked with reports, numerical data, and data checks.  
I now focus on data analysis using Python, statistics, and clear visualisation to support data-driven decisions.

## What I Do

- Analyse data using Python and statistical methods
- Build RESTful web applications with Flask
- Work with relational databases (MySQL)
- Design and evaluate experiments (A/B, A/A/B testing)
- Turn raw data into clear insights and visualisations
